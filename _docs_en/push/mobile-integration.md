## 1. Flocktory Mobile Push integration prerequisits

* Using any SDK makes the mobile application heavier, and as a result, developers tend to limit the number of SDKs used;

* to start work with the functionality of Flocktory Mobile Push it is enough to write 5-7 HTTP requests, which is not a problem for mobile developers

Given the above factors, we decided to abandon the implementation of the SDK in favor of providing an API that will allow you to implement all the functionality and without adding dependencies to the project.


## 2. Requirements:

* Please note that before making any request, you should first execute req. number 7 containg just the site-id key in order to retrieve the values to be used after in every request
    * value of the `__flocktory_web_session2` cookie (will be contained in a `set-cookie` header. This cookie should be used with any request to be executed since.
    * `site-session-id` value which is to be retrieved from the response body `...({"site-session-id":"*",...})`. This should be passed in all further request bodies in a corresponding field (see the examples below)

* If user authorizes while using the app, you should pass the email used to Flocktory. (see below request 7)



## 3. API Description

API functionality consists of

* Passing events and data to Flocktory
* Receiving and processing push notifications

###  3.1 Passing events and data to Flocktory

Here you can see the required curl requests examples.
* The site/site-id/site_id should contain the id of your site in Flocktory system.
* The url parameters should contain a deep-link which will land the user to this very page/screen
* the body parameter should be urlencoded (which is not the case in the examples for the sake of human readability)

### 3.2 Push supscription and notifications processing.

There are two opitons:

* Option 1. You do not collect push subscriptions yet;

* Option 2. You have already collected some subscriptions via an external service;

_Option 1. You do not collect push subscriptions yet._

In this case we recommend using [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)

Most projects already have firebase dependencies in one way or another.
Installing this SDK allows you to work with all the standard features.

* If you already work Flocktory Web Push, the project is already created, and you don't have to create another one

* If you already have a Firevase project, it is necessary to inform your Flocktory account manager on order to agree on the further steps

* Push collection functionality (subscription, resubscription, unsubscription) is on your app dev team. Flocktory only provides a way of passing the subscription event and data (request 8)

* Deep-link functionality is accessible out of the box. We will only need yout dev team to provide us with the structure of your links.


_Option 2. You have already collected some subscriptions via an external service._

In case of correctly implemented push subscription functionality, the work process is as follows:

Flocktory sends notification to GCM/FCM/APN unchanged. To make sure everything works fine we should consult with your dev team and conduct a series of tests

If everything works fine you should implemeny calling method No. 8 to send subscription information to Flocktory.

GCM specifications:

* subscribing users: [android](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client) , [ios](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ios/client)

* [receiving notifications](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/downstream)


##### **Standard data set, passed by Flocktory in a push message**
* landingUrl - link for a user to land on click
* messageTitle - message title, upper push notification part text
* body - general push message text
* iconUrl - icon url

Please mind 
* the landing and icon urls may perform one or more redirects
* even when you are not going to show the image or land at the url, you should still execute the requests in order for the statistics to be collected fully (iconUrl for show, landing url for click)

In case you are using the firebase library to deal with push notifications,  the data mey be obtained as follows ([google documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage)):
```java
public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage){
  Map<String, String> data = remoteMessage.getData();
  RemoteMessage.Notification notification = remoteMessage.getNotification();

  String landingUrl = data.get("url");
  String iconUrl = notification.getIcon();
  String messageTitle = notification.getTitle();
  String messgeBody = notification.getBody();

  // ...
}
```

We also provide the possibility to pass custom key-value pairs in remote message data section in order to solve the problem of specifying the application screen to land the user in case web link does not quite suit your needs. This can be set up in the cabinet when creating a campaign.

```java
  Map<String, String> data = remoteMessage.getData();
  String v1 = data.get("k1");
```

## 4. Stats

All subscription and delivery stats is available in the Flocktory cabinet just like Web Push stats.
